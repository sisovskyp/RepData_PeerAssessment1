This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
unzip ("repdata-data-activity.zip")
activitydata <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
head(activitydata)
tail(activitydata)
str(activitydata)
```

##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

###Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
totalnumber <- data.frame(tapply(activitydata$steps, activitydata$date, sum))
colnames(totalnumber) <- c("steps total")
head(totalnumber)
```

### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
hist(totalnumber$`steps total`, breaks = 100, main = "Histogram of total number of steps per day", xlab = "total number of steps")
```

#Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean <- data.frame(tapply(activitydata$steps, activitydata$date, mean))
colnames(mean) <- c("steps mean")
barplot(mean$`steps mean`, xlab = "date", ylab = "mean of the number of steps", main = "Mean of the total number of steps per day")
```
